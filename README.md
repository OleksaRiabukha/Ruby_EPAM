# EPAM Ruby Lab

Hey everyone, this repository contains solved tasks for EPAM Ruby Lab. Hopefully, it will let me successfully pass the lab. If not, it’s fun anyway.

The structure of repo is pretty simple: tasks from the first phase are in “task_1” folder, main tasks are in “main” folder and bonus are in “bonus_tasks”. Codewars tasks are in “codewars_tasks” folder, as you might expect.

For Codewars tasks, I’ve included links to corresponding katas as adding descriptions could be really messy. Let me know if you’ll need descriptions and I’ll try to figure something out.

Anyways, have a good time and if you’ll need to reach me, the fastest way is –> [Telegram](https://t.me/AlexBukha)
